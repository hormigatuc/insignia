            <h2>Nikon D4s</h2>

            <p>The course of modern imaging has been forged by the talent and ingenuity of working professionals, but also by the introduction of a few cameras so innovative and forward-thinking, they redefined what's possible. The Nikon D4 has been such a camera. And now D4S proves that a great thing really can get better, with remarkable enhancements throughout the entire workflow, dazzling new levels of speed, performance, ISO sensitivity and, of course, the superior image quality of a Nikon camera.</p>

              <p>Like its predecessor, the D4, the D4S delivers a level of image quality that elevates the power of any story. An improved 16.2MP FX-format CMOS image sensor is paired with Nikon's spectacular new image-processing engine, EXPEED 4, for truly phenomenal speed and performance in the field.</p>

              <p>Photographers go where their assignments take them, and this often means working in the high-contrast glare of the midday sun, the low-light at dawn or the poorly illuminated interiors of a sporting venue. </p>

              <h3>Barato</h3>

              <p>D4S is designed to keep you shooting wherever the story brings you, even after others have packed their bags for the day. Its increased ISO range means you'll be able to capture brilliant photos and videos in whatever light is available.</p>
